# machine-learning

Oh how I loved this Artificial Intelligence course from Stanford!  https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

The tutor is this guy:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng

From Linear Regression with One Variable through to Neural Networks - it blew my mind.  You do need some maths (I knew that Pure Maths Degree would prove useful eventually), so dust off your big girl's calculus pants and dive right in.

The language is Octave (or Matlab but you only need to learn a bit).  After that, move on to Python once you get bitten by the AI bug.
